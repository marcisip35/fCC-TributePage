                <h3>Here's a timeline of Dr. Turing's Life</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in London, United Kingdom.</li>
                    <li><strong>1931</strong> - Alan Turing is showing signs of intelligence and studied at King's College from 1931 to 1934 in Cambridge. First in his class and was a honorary student in mathematics.</li>
                    <li><strong>1936</strong> - Studied at Princeton University , building his resume in mathematics and cryptology, building three of fours tages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.</li>
                    <li><strong>1940</strong> - Turing was recruited to create a machine called The Bombe, which was a cryptology machine that was used to decrypt the Enigma Code that the Germans used during WW2</li>
                    <li><strong>1941</strong> - Alan Turing was able to break the code with the work of his Enigma Machine, helping the Allies in World War 2 decrypt German messages primarily in the sea.</li>
                    <li><strong>1946</strong> - After World War 2, Alan Turing continued his work in the new field of Computer Science. He presented the first ever detailed-design of a stored program computer setup.</li>
                    <li><strong>1948</strong> - Turing created the LU decomposition method, which is a method still used today to solve matrix equations.</li>
                    <li><strong>1950</strong> - The turing test was created in 1950, the test was used to compare the intelligence of a machine and a human brain</li>
                    <li><strong>1952</strong> - Turing was caught in a relationship with the same sex. He was convicted of indecency because homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom during this time. This part of his life took a turn for the worse, for Alan</li>
                    <li><strong>1954</strong> - Alan Turing would commit suicide on June 8, 1954, in his house. His housekeeper would find him dead.</li>
                    <p>Alan turing was a pivotal figure in the field of math, tech and computer science. Dubbed as the father of Computer Science, his works during his lifetime set the path for numerous discoveries in the tech field. His Enigma Machine saved millions of lives during the War, and helped the Allies win the War several years early. Although having a tragic personal story as a gay man, many wouldn't recognize Turing as a important figure until years have passed after his death, this is because of the Government brushing his works under the rug and not giving him praise because he was charged for being homosexual. Alan Turing's work would set the path for modern Computers, and he is now a well known figure in history.</p>
                    <p>"<em>Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of, who do the things no one can imagine.</em>" - Alan Turing</p>
